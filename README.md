# Getting Started with Create React App

Main goal of this repo is to try to bundle a full react ui, widget or otherwise into a single bundle using rollup.

## Development

For development is 100% a CRA setup. Run `npm start` and start developing. Ejecting is fine to.

## Bundling

Run `npm run build:rollup` and it will bundle entire react app into a single js bundle. The JS bundle is self contained as it will create its mounting point if that was not present on the html where it was being called form. JS, CSS, SVG, Image src etc, all are bundled into the same bundle.

For regular webpack bundle (many files, separate css, js etc), run `npm run build`. It will use the default CRA build.
Or yuu can eject and customize it even further which is fine.

## TS Path alias

Currently it is not provided. let me know if its needed :)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
